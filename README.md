## Project Overview

This project builds upon the **SUBLIME** GSL framework with custom datasets to perform tweet analysis focused on extremism and narrative features.

## Datasets

1. **ARENAS**
   - **Description:** Contains 298 tweets annotated for extremism and narrative features.
   - **Filename:** `2024_08_SCHEMA_A1.xlsx`
2. **Full_french_tweet_data** -**Description** Contains around 40000 tweets with various informations about the tweet and some about the user who posted it -**Filename** `All_french_tweet_data.csv`

## Experiments

The repository includes set-ups the currently implemented experiments :
All modifications of parameters are done in `experiment_params.csv`.
Default config is exp_nb 0, so start from there when modifying.

1. **Experiment 1** First try of SUBLIME
   - **Description:** Uses Schema A1 with the `french-document-embedding` model.
   - **Configuration:** Set `exp_nb` argument to `1` and `epoch` to `1000`.
   - **Execution:** Run
   ```bash
   python src/main.py -exp_nb 1
   ```
2. **Experiment 2** Filtering out tweets that are not extremist narratives

   - **Description:** Uses Schema A1 with the `french-document-embedding` model, with filtering out nodes without both IN GROUP and OUT GROUP.
   - **Configuration:** Set `exp_nb` argument to `2` and `epoch` to `1000`.
   - **Execution:** Run

   ```bash
   python src/main.py -exp_nb 2
   ```

3. **Experiment 3** First test of increasing the nb of epochs
   - **Description:** Uses Schema A1 with the `french-document-embedding` model, applies filtering as in Experiment 2, and increases the iterations of SUBLIME to `4000`.
   - **Configuration:** Set `exp_nb` argument to `3` and `epoch` to `4000`.
   - **Execution:** Run
   ```bash
   python src/main.py -exp_nb 3
   ```
4. **Experiment 4** Run SUBLIME on bigger dataset Full_french_tweet.csv
   - **Description:** Uses Full_french_tweet.csv with the `french-document-embedding` model, applies filtering as in Experiment 2, and increases the iterations of SUBLIME to `4000`.
   - **Configuration:** Set `exp_nb` argument to `4` and `epoch` to `4000`.
   - **Execution:** Run
   ```bash
   python src/main.py -exp_nb 4
   ```

## Quick Start

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ARENAS-Project-EU/Graph_Structure_Learning.git
   cd Graph_Structure_Learning
   ```

2. **Installation**
   Set Up Virtual Environment:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate # On Windows use `.venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

   Install Dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Please note that the dgl (Deep Graph Library) install is a CPU install not GPU so you may encounter errors

3. **Run the Experiment Script**
   Update the configuration in `experiment_params.csv` and run

   ```bash
   python src/main.py -exp_nb 1
   ```

   Replace 1 with the correct experiment number.
   After running this, you should have the tweet embeddings in `embeddings`, the resulting matrices in `adjacency_matrices` and a plot of the loss in `plots`.

4. **Postprocessing and Analysis**:

   Currently, choosing the dataset to study is based on changing the experiment_nb and Dataset class at the beginning of the main method.
   Make sure to use the right adjacency file for the experiment chosen.
   To run the analysis, choose the functions you want to run by modifying new_graph_eval.py:

   ```bash
   python src/new_graph_eval.py
   ```

## Acknowledgements
This work was conducted as part of the European [Arenas](https://arenasproject.eu/) project, funded by Horizon Europe.
Its objective is to characterize, measure, and understand the role of extremist narratives in discourses that have an impact not only on political and social spheres but importantly on the stakeholders themselves.â€¯ Leading an innovative and ambitious research program, ARENAS will significantly contribute to filling the gap in contemporary research, make recommendations to policymakers, media, lawyers, social inclusion professionals, and educational institutions, and propose solutions for countering extreme narratives for developing more inclusive and respectful European societies.
